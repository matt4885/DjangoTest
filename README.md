# DjangoTest
Testing website development through python+django 

The plan is to create a fitness website that you can input your workouts and health statistics, which in turn the website will take those values as a function and then calculate a workout program for you, designed for bulking, cutting, strength, toning, or just general fitness. Additionally, the website will recommend certain foods and will alert you when to eat (if kept in the background running). 

RK - THIS IS A TEST
